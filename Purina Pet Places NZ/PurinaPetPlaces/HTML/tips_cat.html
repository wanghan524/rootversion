<h1>Attack Cats</h1>
<p>Cats that regularly attack their owners can do so for a variety of reasons. Establishing the cause of your cat's aggression is vital. In some cases providing your cat with more opportunities to play with toys and carefully managing the play sessions can help.</p>

<h1>Night Play</h1>
<p>If your cat is disturbing you with their play behaviour at night, remember cats are nocturnal. Try shifting their active phase by playing with them earlier in the evening. This might make bedtime quieter.</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Boredom</h1>
<p>Cats can get bored just like dogs! Try providing your cat with an activity centre which can include a place to scratch, interesting textures to explore and exciting smells like catnip.</p>

<h1>Jumping on Benches</h1>
<p>Cats love food and being up high, so they often jump on kitchen benches. Try putting double sided tape or tinfoil on the bench to deter them, and provide your cat with other high spaces like a shelf.</p>

<h1>Kittens - Introducing Them to Food</h1>
<p>Introduce solid food to kittens from four weeks old, three times a day. If using biscuits, mix one part kitten biscuits with two parts water, gradually decreasing the water until they are eating only dry biscuits. Don't leave wet food out and ensure clean water is available at all times.</p>

<h1>Kittens - Introducing Them to Toys</h1>
<p>The best kitten toys are free and found at home, saving a small fortune - toilet roll cylinders, empty cardboard boxes, ping pong balls, upturned cane bread basket over the kitten, or a feather boa on a stick. You can also find a whole range of toys from pet stores.</p>

<h1>Cats are Natural Grazers</h1>
<p>Cats tend to graze on their food so offer dry food so they can snack throughout the day. It is important however to watch your cats weight and adjust food amounts accordingly.</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Transitioning Your Pets to Dry Food or A New Diet</h1>
<p>When moving your cat from wet to dry food, do so gradually by introducing the new food over 5 -7 days to avoid stomach upsets caused by sudden diet change. Try wet food at the bottom of the bowl and dry food on top so they munch through the biscuits to get to the wet food.</p>

<h1>Fun Things to Do With Your Cat</h1>
<p>Play fetch with ping pong balls. Some cats will fetch it, some will pounce on it and “rabbit kick” with their back legs. Play hide and seek or suspend a half toilet roll cylinder blowing in the breeze.</p>

<h1>Dealing With Fussy Cats</h1>
<p>Choose a good quality food and don't offer too much variety – making them fussy. Provide clean water, serve food in clean bowls at room temperature and give your cat privacy when it eats. Most cats will eat when they realise nothing else is coming and their tummy rumbles.</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Cat Flu/Snuffles</h1>
<p>Even after being vaccinated, cats can still get the snuffles. Vaccination helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms. However, If your cat is sneezing, has a runny nose or discharge from the eyes it can be treatable with antibiotics from your Vet.</p>

<h1>Pet Grooming Cats and Dogs</h1>
<p>Groom your pet once a week to prevent tangles, and decrease the incidence of fur balls in your cat's throat. Grooming gives you loving time with your pet and a chance to check their skin and coat.</p>

<h1>Travelling With Pets</h1>
<p>Ensure your pet is in a secure carry cage stowed safely in the car away from petrol fumes. Cover the cage to help settle your pet and keep the sun off them. Do not leave your pet unattended in the car!</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Using Flat Bowls to Feed Cats</h1>
<p>Cats prefer a flat bowl because they don't like the feeling of their whiskers being tickled. Cats' whiskers are like antennas telling them how close something is. Offer your cat a flat bowl and see the difference. They will enjoy their food so much more.</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Cat Fresh Water</h1>
<p>Provide your cat with a constant supply of clean fresh water. Cats have trouble seeing still water, so water fountains with a moving flow of water are a great idea as they can see the ripples.</p>
<span class="divider">&nbsp;</span>
<h1>Litter Tray</h1>
<p>Keep your cat's litter tray clean and make sure your cat knows where it is. If your cat is toileting elsewhere, place another litter tray in that area. Remember that cats prefer privacy. An array of litters and litter trays liners are available. Experiment with litter types as your cat may have a preference.</p>
