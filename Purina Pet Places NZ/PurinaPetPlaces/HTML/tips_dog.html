<h1>Socialising Puppies</h1>
<p>Socialising your puppy is vital. The more new positive experiences your puppy has, the better adjusted they will be. Puppy Preschools are an ideal way to socialise your puppy safely while they are not fully vaccinated.</p>

<h1>General Training</h1>
<p>Successful dog training is based on reward. Be consistent and remember that dogs only understand immediate consequences. You have a 3 second window to reward or correct behaviours, outside of that time any reward or punishment will have little effect.</p>

<h1>Separation Anxiety</h1>
<p>It is important to leave your new puppy alone regularly for short periods of time, with a treat to keep them occupied. Don't make a fuss when leaving or returning. This will help to avoid your puppy developing separation anxiety.</p>

<h1>Barking</h1>
<p>Dogs bark for many different reasons. Keeping your dog occupied with toys and treats, exercising them every day, and restricting their view of the front of your section can help.</p>

<h1>Boredom</h1>
<p>All dogs get bored and without company can become destructive. Provide your dog with toys, rotating them so they stay novel and interesting. Always exercise your dog before leaving them alone, so they are more likely to sleep than be destructive.</p>
